## Overview

Individuals with intellectual impairments often excel in practical skills like beadwork, carpentry, farming, and textile crafting (e.g., making mats). However, they face challenges in managing their creations for financial gain due to literacy and numeracy barriers. Additionally, the absence of inclusive marketplaces further limits their economic independence and opportunities to thrive.

This project seeks to solve these issues by developing a user-friendly platform where artisans can showcase their work and manage sales, with the assistance of trusted loved ones if needed.

## Features

- **Artisan Profile Management**: Artisans or their loved ones can create and manage profiles to display their work.
- **Product Showcase**: A dedicated space for artisans to post their creations such as beadwork, carpentry, and mat-making items.
- **Marketplace Connectivity**: An integrated global marketplace where potential buyers can discover and purchase products.
- **Inclusive User Interface**: A simplified, intuitive design catered to users with intellectual impairments.
